Description: Network based diffusion analysis (NBDA) allows inference on
             the asocial and social transmission of information.  This may involve
             the social transmission of a particular behaviour such as tool use, for example.
            For the NBDA, the key parameters estimated are the social effect and baseline rate 
            parameters.  The baseline rate parameter gives the rate at which the behaviour
            is first performed (or acquired) asocially amongst the individuals in a given population.
            The social effect parameter quantifies the effect of the social associations amongst 
            the individuals on the rate at which each individual first performs or displays
            the behaviour.  Spatial NBDA involves incorporating spatial information in the analysis.  
            This is done by incorporating social networks derived from 
            spatial point patterns (of the home bases of the individuals under study).  In addition, 
            a spatial covariate such as vegetation cover, or slope may be included in the modelling
            process.
